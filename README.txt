This is a text-based game where you're tasked with looking after dogs as they come to your day care. Dogs will need to
be fed, cleaned and walked to keep them happy. You must be careful of the order though, as walking a dog will make them
hungry, thirsty and require them to be brushed! There are several breeds which have their own characteristics such as
fur colour and walk length. This doesn't yet affect anything but this is something I'd like to add next!
